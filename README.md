# arXiv Preprint Matching

This is a COMET enrichment and curation workflow pilot project. Go to the [Pilot Projects Overview Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/14) to see all of the pilots.  

## Objective

The preprint matching strategy aims to establish links between arXiv preprints (identified by their DOIs registered in DataCite) and their corresponding published journal article DOIs in Crossref. 

## Getting Involved 

COMET is in the process of setting up a Github space for ideas and feedback from the COMET community. In the meantime, get involved by: 
* providing input on project at [the pilot project epic](https://github.com/cometadata/arxiv-preprint-matching/issues/12)
* viewing the project's progress at the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/5)
* contributing topcis about this pilot by opening an issue in this repo, or
* contacting COMET's Project Lead, Dione Mentis, at [dione.mentis@datacite.org](mailto:dione.mentis@datacite.org)
