# **Crossref Preprint Matching**

Modified form of [Search Based Matching with Validation (SBMV) preprint matching strategy](https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/marple/-/blob/main/strategies_available/preprint_sbmv/strategy.py?ref_type=heads) developed by [@dtkaczyk](https://github.com/dtkaczyk). 

This code is intended to evaluate the soundness of the strategy in [arxiv-preprint-matching](https://github.com/cometadata/arxiv-preprint-matching) by testing it against the benchmark dataset used in the original SBMV preprint matching strategy, where journal articles are matched to preprints in Crossref alone.


## **Installation**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## **Usage**
```
python preprint_match_data_files.py -i INPUT_FILE -f FORMAT -m EMAIL -u USER_AGENT [OPTIONS]
```
### **Required Arguments**

* `--max-query-len`: Maximum length of the query string sent to Crossref (default: 5000).

#### **File Processing & API Handling:**

* `--timeout`: Request timeout (connect, read) in seconds (default: 10 30).  
* `--max-retries`: Maximum number of retries for failed API requests (default: 3).  
* `--backoff-factor`: Exponential backoff factor for retries (default: 0.5).  
* `--max-consecutive-line-failures`: Maximum number of consecutive lines that fail processing within a single file before halting processing for that file (default: 10).  
* `--max-consecutive-file-failures`: Maximum number of consecutive files that fail processing before halting the entire script (default: 3).

## **Examples**

Process a file `input_data/works_to_match.json` and save CSV results to `output_results/`:

```
python preprint_match_data_files.py -i input_data/works_to_match.json -o output_results/ -f csv -m <your_email@example.com> -u "MatchingTool/1.1 (mailto:your_email@example.com)"
```

Process a file `preprints/crossref_data.json`, saving JSON results to the default `./output directory`, with detailed logging and custom API/strategy settings:

```
python preprint_match_data_files.py -i preprints/crossref_data.json -f json -m <your_email@example.com> -u "arXivPreprintMatcher/1.0"   
 -ll DEBUG -lf matching.log -lc   
 --min-score 0.8 --weight-title 1.5 --weight-author 1.0   
 --timeout 15 45 --max-retries 5 --max-consecutive-line-failures 20
```

## **Description of Strategy**

This strategy attempts to find preprint matches for published works inputs. It uses the Crossref API and applies scoring based on metadata similarity.

### Search Approach and Candidate Filtering

1. A bibliographic query string is built using metadata extracted from the input Crossref JSON: the main `title` (and `subtitle`, if present), `publication year`, and the family names of authors. These fields are normalized using unidecode, lowercasing, and removing punctuation before constructing the query.  
2. The query searches the Crossref `/works` endpoint, using the `query.bibliographic` parameter and returning up to 25 candidates. The maximum query length is capped (default 5000).  
3. Candidates retrieved from Crossref are filtered to include only preprints by accepting only works where the type field `posted-content`.

### Scoring Logic, Weights, and Heuristics:

The strategy employs weighted scoring based on year, title, and author similarity, incorporating fuzzy matching and heuristics.

* **Year Score:**  
  * Compares the published article's year with the preprint candidate's year of publication.  
  * A score is assigned based on the difference between the published work and candidate's year of publication (`article_year - preprint_year`): a score of 0.0 is given if the difference is negative (article published before preprint). A score of 1.0 is given for a difference of 0-2 years, 0.9 for 3 years, 0.8 for 4 years, and 0.0 for all larger differences. 
* **Title Score:**  
  * Compares normalized titles. Normalization includes converting Unicode strings to their ASCII representation, lowercasing, and removal of punctuation.  
  * Uses a weighted blend of fuzzy matching scores from the rapidfuzz library: `0.4 * token_set_ratio + 0.4 * token_sort_ratio + 0.2 * WRatio`.  
  * Applies a penalty (`*= 0.7`) if one title starts with a keyword (e.g., "correction", "erratum", "reply", "retraction") while the other does not.  
* **Author Score:**  
  * Applies several heuristics for comparing normalized author lists from the article and the preprint candidate:  
    * A match between valid, normalized ORCIDs results in a similarity score of 1.0 for that author pair.  
    * For authors without an ORCID match, the strategy iteratively finds the most similar pair of authors between the two lists using `fuzz.token_sort_ratio` on pre-calculated name variations (e.g., "J Smith", "Smith J", "John Smith").  
    * For efficiency, when a record contains large author lists, the strategy compares sorted strings of all family names using fuzz.token_sort_ratio.  
    * The final author score is based on the sum of matched pair scores, normalized by the total number of authors from both lists: (`2.0 * score_sum) / total_authors`.  
* **Final Weighted Score:** Calculated as: (`weight_year * year_score + weight_title * title_score + weight_author * author_score) / (total_weights)`. Default weights heavily favor the title (`2.0`), followed by authors (`0.8`), and year (`0.4`).

### Match Selection

1. Only candidates achieving a final weighted score greater than or equal to a min_score (default `0.85`) are considered potential matches.  
2. Among these, only candidates whose scores are within max_score_diff (default `0.03`) of the highest score are returned as the final match to select the best result when multiple candidates have similar high scores.
